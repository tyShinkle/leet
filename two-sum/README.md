# Two Sum

## Problem

#### Difficulty - Easy

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
  
You may assume that each input array will have exactly one solution. You may not use any element of the array more than once.

You can return your answer as two indices in any order.
